<h2><a name="_v168aqwnu0ht"></a><span lang=EN>Introduction</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>This
summer I participated in a very interesting research project in the Google
Summer of Code 2021 program. The work was coordinated by Tommi Pirinen and Jack
Rueter, with whom we have been working earlier in different projects,
especially in connection with the Karelian language. Karelian has a large
number of dictionaries, and also electronic resources, but there are several
translation directions that are often missing, or less complete. In this
project we wanted to improve the situation. The resources created during the
summer are openly available, and we hope they will contribute future dictionary
work in the Karelian language, which is a field that certainly needs continued
development to flourish. </span></p>

<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><a name="_p56phccjhtzz"></a><span
lang=EN>Karelian dictionaries</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>Karelian
has two main varieties, Karelian Proper and Livvi Karelian. Finnish is also
closely related, and within Karelian there is a complex dialect continuum. The
task was to approve of translation pairs for the three languages Finnish-Livvi,
Finnish-Karelian and Karelian-Livvi. Defining the varieties used in this work
was not trivial, and is a topic that could be discussed in great length. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>One
problem is the definition of the language Karelian Proper (krl), this is, in
fact, problematic since it is represented by two different writing systems, a
northern variant published in the newspaper Vienan karjala and southern variant
native to Tver. The language form used in this project features that of
northern Karelian Proper as described in the Russian-Northern Karelian Proper
dictionary of 2015 (Русско-карельский словарь (севернокарельские диалекты) =
Venäjä-viena šanakirja / сост.: Зайков П. M. [и др.]. – Петрозаводск:
Периодика, 2015. – 360 с. ISBN 978-5-88170-255-7.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>The
Finnish-Livvi (fin-olo) translation pairs were extended from materials from an
open-source project funded through the Kone Language Programme begun in 2013.
Since I had been working with these materials in that time, they familiar for
me and this revisit was very useful and productive, and also different from
other language pairs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN><a
href="https://apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-olo/apertium-fin-olo.fin-olo.dix.html"><span
style='color:#1155CC'>https://apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-olo/apertium-fin-olo.fin-olo.dix.html</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>For
example, work with the Finnish-(Northern) Karelian Proper (fin-krl) required
personal knowledge of the language and the use of a Russian-Karelian (Northern
Karelian Proper) dictionary. With these resources, however, the dictionary was
possible to extend very well. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN><a

style='color:#1155CC'>https://apertium.github.io/apertium-fin-krl/apertium-fin-krl.fin-krl.dix.html</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>Now,
the Karelian-Livvi dictionary work was a totally different issue. No previous
dictionaries, written or online, were available. It’s also an important example
about work where a dictionary is built between two endangered language
varieties, or the varieties of same language. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN><a
href="https://github.com/apertium/apertium-krl-olo"><span style='color:#1155CC'>https://github.com/apertium/apertium-krl-olo</span></a>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>For
this last dictionary, Khalid Alnajar, who had worked on the advancement of the
Veʹrdd online dictionary editing platform in GSoC 2020 (<a
href="https://www.khalidalnajjar.com/verdd-dictionary-editing-tool/"><span
style='color:#1155CC'>https://www.khalidalnajjar.com/verdd-dictionary-editing-tool/</span></a>)
used an algorithm he had developed for predicting translation pairs in previous
projects. It was very nice to see such continuing collaboration between these
projects from different summers. Karelian-Livvi dictionary part was indeed very
different from other languages I worked on this period. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>The
task of approving translations was done according to two basic workflows. One
was something I could perform directly online in Veʹrdd, and the other involved
collaboration with others working with the Veʹrdd multilingual dictionary
databases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>The
first alternative was to use the online Veʹrdd editing platform, where
source-language words could be searched for in many numbers of ways, such as
part of speech, but it also supports regular expressions and filtering for
approved word pairs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>The
second alternative applied the inherent knowledge of Verdd content in
coordination with algorithmic predictions of feasible translation pairs. In
this latter workflow my duty as editor was to approve all correct translation
pairs even if they were secondary meanings. The results of this second flow
were then automatically uploaded to the system and approved for further
download and incorporation into the Apertium github repositories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>After completing my editing work, my mentor
Jack Rueter went over the materials before checking them into the Apertium
github repositories. Links to the history below show the input from our work in
order they were done in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Finnish-Livvi dictionary contains 30,212

translation pairs</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Karelian-Livvi dictionary contains 6,419
translation pairs</span></p>

<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><a name="_95ye26t7y0g8"></a><span
lang=EN>Remaining questions</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>One
issue is whether proper names should be included in the dictionary. From a
machine translation perspective place names are definitely a must, but maybe
there should also be room for personal names. When we delve into local place
names, finding Finnish equivalents becomes problematic, as there may be
historical names available,  on the one hand, and an absence of them, on the
other. So where do we go to find the Finnish place name, a difficult Russian
transliteration or an easier fit from Karelian or Livvi? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>The
Finnish orthographic solution may also present problems. Should the non-native
hushed sibilants be written š and ž or sh and zh? Should the vowels be written
long as they are in Karelian and Livvi, or short as they are in Russian, e.g.
Tuuksa in Finnish or Tuksa, which is a simple transliteration of the Russian
Тукса. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>Some
of these are questions that should not be solved at levels of individual
dictionaries, but when we create new resources from different dictionaries, it
would be beneficial to harmonize the result one way or another. Lastly,
dictionary work is never complete and there are always some missing lexemes and
translations, which hopefully will be covered in future work.</span></p>
